\title{Fill Missing Values}
\usage{
fillMissing(x, span = 10, Dates = NULL, max.fill = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the sequence of observations. Missing values are permitted and will
be replaced.}

\item{span}{the maximum number of observations on each side of each range of
missing values to use in constructing the time-series model. See
\bold{Details}.}

\item{Dates}{an optional vector of dates/times associated with each value 
in \code{x}. Useful if there are gaps in dates/times.}

\item{max.fill}{the maximum gap to fill.}
}
\value{
The observations in \code{x} with missing values replaced by
interpolation.
}
\description{
Replace missing values in time-series data by interpolation.
}
\details{
Missing values at the beginning and end of \code{x} will not be replaced. \cr

The argument \code{span} is used to help set the range of values used to
construct the \code{StructTS} model. If \code{span} is set small, then the
variance of epsilon dominates and the estimates are not smooth. If
\code{span} is large, then the variance of level dominates and the estimates
are linear interpolations. The variances of level and epsilon are components
of the state-space model used to interpolate values, see \code{\link{StructTS}} for details. 
See \bold{Note} for more information about the method.\cr

If \code{span} is set larger than 99, then the entire time series is used to
estimate all missing values.  This approach may be useful if there are many
periods of missing values. If \code{span} is set to any number less than 4,
then simple linear interpolation will be used to replace missing values.
}
\note{
The method used to interpolate missing values is based on
\code{tsSmooth} constructed using \code{StructTS} on \code{x} with
\code{type} set to "trend." The smoothing method basically uses the
information (slope) from two values previous to missing values and the two
values following missing values to smoothly interpolate values accounting for
any change in slope. Beauchamp (1989) used time-series methods for synthesizing
missing streamflow records. The group that is used to define the statistics that
control the interpolation is very simply defined by \code{span} rather than
the more in-depth measures described in Elshorbagy and others (2000).

If the data have gaps rather than missing values, then fillMissing will return
a vector longer than \code{x} if \code{Dates} is given and the return data
cannot be inserted into the original data frame. If \code{Dates} is not given,
then the gap will be recognized and not be filled. The function
\code{insertMissing} can be used to create a data frame with the complete
sequence of dates.
